# Advanced Computer Vision

The repository contains 8 mini-projects which are built upon majorly two libraries [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). While MediaPipe offers a number of functionalities to perform hand tracking, pose estimation etc, OpenCV helps users to interact with these models.

The amazing thing about all of these projects is that they run on **CPU** in real-time!

## Hand Tracking

Detecting and tracking 21 3D hand landmarks at around 25 frames per second. To see the code go [here](handTracking).

## Pose Estimation

Finding and tracking 33 3D full-body landmarks from an image or video. To see the code go [here](poseEstimation).

## Face Detection

Recognize 6 face landmarks. To see the code go [here](faceDetection).
