# Advanced Computer Vision

The repository contains 9 mini-projects which are built upon majorly two libraries [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). While MediaPipe offers a number of functionalities to perform hand tracking, pose estimation etc, OpenCV helps users to interact with these models.

All of these projects run on the **CPU** in real-time.

## Hand Tracking

Detecting and tracking 21 3D hand landmarks at around 25 frames per second. To see the code go [here](handTracking).

## Pose Estimation

Finding and tracking 33 3D full-body landmarks from an image or video. To see the code go [here](poseEstimation).

## Face Detection

Recognize 6 face landmarks. To see the code go [here](faceDetection).

## Face Mesh

Spots 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. To see the code go [here](faceMesh).

## Hand Volume Control

Controls the volume of Windows with your fingers. To see the code go [here](volumeControl).

## Finger Counting

Count the number of fingers in a frame. To see the code go [here](fingerCounting).

## Personal Trainer

Deploying a pose estimation module to track the movements of the body. To see the code go [here](personalTrainer).

## Virtual Painter

A canvas to select a tool to paint. To see the code go [here](virtualPainter).

## Virtual Mouse

After waving your hand in the air you can play music or pretty much do any task. To see the code go [here](virtualMouse).
